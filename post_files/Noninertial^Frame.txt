I enjoy sharing my story - story of my work, thoughts, and life. There exist various 
platforms that could satisfy my needs. Yet, using them would dilute the identity of 
my stories because my thoughts would reside in a foreign world. 
Though Facebook or Google Drive Documents are enough to cover my volatile emotions, 
I wanted a website that represents me and the projects I do - a domain, solely 
for me, to portray the trace of the professional side of my life. I wish the visitors 
and readers of <strong>Noninertial Frame</strong>, including myself, could look into 
the steps I take and see how I learn and grow. We would hopefully find inspiration and 
motivation to take to our own lives.

Noninertial frame, by definition, is <i>a frame of reference that moves with the object, 
so that the moving object appears to violate Newton's laws of motion since it accelerates 
despite having no horizontal forces on it (Dictionary.com). </i> It is a frame whose velocity 
is continuously changing and in which classical laws of mechanics do not work. It is also 
the real frame we live or should live in because our world moves every moment. 
"Non-inertial Frame" is also the the name of the high school physics project team of 
my best friend and me. It was the first project I pulled an all-nighter for of 
my own will. Such meanings make <strong>Noninertial Frame</strong> a suitable 
name of a place to represents myself. The progress and results of my projects and  
what I learned or felt in the process will be the primary content. This  
website uses MongoDB, Node.js, and Express.js stack and Heroku as its server. 
Its source code is uploaded at my <a href="https://github.com/noninertialframe/noninertialframe.github.io">
Github repository</a>. I want to keep track of and share my progress. Sharing the 
code would be both beneficial for me, pushing me to keep the code clean, and anyone else 
who also plans to create his or her own website. It would be grateful to receive commits, feedback, or 
comments under the posts.

Building <strong>Noninertial Frame</strong> has taken me a little more than two months, 
including the time to learn web development. I 
began by studying a Node.js book and selectively listening to lectures of 
<a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/"><i>The Web Development Bootcamp</i></a> on Udemy. 
Since the amount of time I could be on the computer is highly restricted in the 
current environment, around an hour per day on average, I first tried to write the 
code out on paper. This plan turned out to be 
extremely difficult and demotivating because I was not familiar with Javascript or 
the framework and this project involved web designing. Not being able to search Google 
as I code was pretty stressful. I just started to code on computer. Though coding 
became much more easier, the amount time for coding became limited. This restraint 
has had both ups and downs. I could stay fully concentrated for the given time because 
I felt the pressure to complete as many tasks as possible. I felt the joy of writing code 
when I achieved the goals planned for each day. However, I sometimes had to leave the computer 
at the peak of my focus or with my current progress unfinished. The frustration in such 
situations hindered me from falling asleep for a while. Nevertheless, in general, 
the time constraint allowed me to enjoy taking small but steady steps forward 
and to anticipate a more complete state of my website on the following day. 
Indeed, I am thinking of using a stopwatch for my work or study to raise efficiency 
when I return to school. Other than the environment I am in, the design aspect has 
been challenging for me. While I quickly caught a grasp of how backend works and 
interacts with the client side, I did not thoroughly understand web design 
using CSS; sometimes, I could not expect how my CSS would turn out on the screen.
I eventually succeeded in creating the design I pictured through countless numbers 
of trial and error and Google search.

Building <strong>Noninertial Frame</strong> was not as difficult as I thought at first; 
in fact, writing high-quality posts seems to be thousand times harder. What is important 
is that I have led the project to its final stage of opening it to the world, instead of 
leaving it as a prototype. It 
has been a smooth takeoff; and, its enthusiasm and excitement is sufficient to drive me to 
the next project, which is related to data and machine learning. 
The due date for the next project will be around July, unless its scale becomes really large, 
and its progress will be updated on April or May. KEEP UP!
